## Software Development

1. generate code for task.
2. verify the code lints, compiles, builds, etc. go to 1 until verified.
3. generate appropriate tests (unit, property-based, integration, etc) for the code.
4. verify that all tests pass, go to 3 until verified.
5. run the app.
6. verify that the code functions correctly (use curl/jq/etc to verify endpoint, verify client changes, etc), go to 1 until verified.

- Lint: `[lint command]`
- Lint: `[lint command]`
- Compile: `[compile command]`
- Tests: `[test command]`
