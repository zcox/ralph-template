0a. Study `specs/*` to learn the application specifications.
0b. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (if present) to understand the plan so far.
0c. Study source code to understand how things are already implemented.

1. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (if present; it may be incorrect) and study existing source code and compare it against `specs/*`. Analyze findings, prioritize tasks, and create/update @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md as a bullet point list sorted in priority of items yet to be implemented. Ultrathink. Consider searching for TODO, minimal implementations, placeholders, skipped/flaky tests, and inconsistent patterns. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to determine starting point for research and keep it up to date with items considered complete/incomplete. @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md will be used in future sessions to determine the next most important task to perform, so it's vital that the file is well-orgnanized, clear, and accurate for the success of those future sessions.
2. Appropriate tests should always be included at each step of the plan, NEVER as a separate final step at the very end of the plan. Generated code should always be tested and verified.

IMPORTANT: Plan only. Do NOT implement anything. Do NOT assume functionality is missing; confirm with code search first.
